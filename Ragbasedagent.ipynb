LangGraph offers a more flexible and full-featured framework for building agents, including support for tool-calling, persistence of state, and human-in-the-loop workflows. For details, refer to the `LangGraph documentation <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_ as well as guides for `Migrating from AgentExecutor <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/>`_ and LangGraph's `Pre-built ReAct agent <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent/>`_.\n",
